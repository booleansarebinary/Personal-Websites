            <p class="intro">I started sleeping before I was 0 years old, and have always been passionate about exploring and teaching this art.
            If I'm not awake, I'm sleeping!</p>

              <h3>Teaching & Education</h3>
              <p>I have accumulated over 55,000 hours in my area of expertise. I have also given talks to over 100 people
              and have personally tutored 10 people in the arts of sleeping. My first short story, "The Art of Sleep," came out last year,
              and it has raised significant awareness about the sleepless epidemic. </p>

              <h3>Work Experience</h3>
              <img class="work" src="images/suitcase.png" alt="">
              <p class="work-description">I founded "I Can't Sleep" in 2007, and since then, I've been instrumental
                  in the starting of two divisions, "I Can't Sleep-Snooze" (2017) and "I Can't Sleep-Speech" (2021).
              I also actively take part in the development of new sleep methods, and have tested and created more than 30 ways to slumber.</p>
